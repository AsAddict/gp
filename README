# gp

;; This code defines and runs a genetic programming system on the problem
;; of finding a function that fits a particular set of [x y] pairs.

;; The aim here is mostly to demonstrate how genetic programming can be 
;; implemented in Clojure simply and clearly, and several things are 
;; done in somewhat inefficient and/or non-standard ways. But this should 
;; provide a reasonable starting point for developing more efficient/
;; standard/capable systems.
